# Welcome to a Basic Cypher Guide
Cypher is arguably one of the best agents in Valorant right now. However, many people fail to get the highest value out of him, and this guide is dedicated to teaching new users and veterans alike the ins and outs of playing Cypher.

## Spy Camera
Cypher's main ability is his spy camera, which he can place on walls or obstacles. It has a 180 degree field of view, and is invisible when not being used. It can shoot a dart to mark enemies; once the dart hits, the enemies have to take it out or else there location will be pinged continuously. While the dart is very powerful, it should not be used as it will easily give away the location of your camera. Instead of using the dart, one should call out to their team where the enemy is, so that the camera can continue gathering intel, rather than be a one time usage.

## Tripwires
Cypher's tripwires slow down any enemies that run into them, and if they don't destroy the wire in time, they will become disoriented. They are invisible until one gets very close to them. One should use this ability to watch flanks or to place in common areas where enemies are for sure going to walk through and not expect the wire at the same time. If a wire is destroyed, the player will be notified and key intel is gathered on enemies' locations. However, wires can be jumped over or crouched under, so they should be placed at crouch height, directly aligned with your face so that the wires can't be avoided.

## Cages
Cypher's smoke cages are incredibly powerful. When an enemy makes contact with the edges of the smoke cage, a loud sound will be made. The best use of these cages are to place them in choke points so that when enemies walk through them, one could just spray the choke point and get an easy kill, without the enemies seeing them at all. The cages can also be used for one-way strats, which means that if placed correctly, you would able to see the enemy's feet and spray them, but they can't see you.

## Ultimate
Cypher's Neural Theft Ultimate requires a dead body to be activated, and pings the real time location of all enemies that are current alive. The time before a cypher cannot use this ultimate on a dead body anymore is 20 seconds. It is the most powerful intel ultimate in the game, and should be used in a equal numbers situation, like a 3v3, to give your team a huge advantage. If one is feeling it, they can also use it in clutch situations, like 1v4s. It requires 7 ultimate points to charge up.
